## Deprecated Packages
> Need to add deprecated notice to README.md + call out deprecation plans with the next PL release
1. Liquid
2. Mustache
3. Nunjucks
4. Twig (non-PHP Twig)
5. Underscore


## Questions
1. What is live-server doing? Is it still needed?


## Next Actions
- Blog post summarizing the big picture of changes (what to expect, why, benefits, etc)
- Add package.json files per component in UIKit to prep for next round of customization work (add new components, use just what you need, etc)
- Create a demos PL landing page (Twig, Mustache, etc)
  - Deploy to now.sh
