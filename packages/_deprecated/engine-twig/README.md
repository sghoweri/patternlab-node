## The Twig PatternEngine for Pattern Lab / Node

To install the Twig engine in your edition, `npm install @pattern-lab/engine-twig` should do the trick.

## Supported features

Level of support is more or less full. Partial calls and lineage hunting are supported. Twig does not support the mustache-specific syntax extensions, style modifiers and pattern parameters, because their use cases are addressed by the core Twig feature set.

We are looking for help with the following issues:

* [Pattern Lab does not support twig extends](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/issues/554)
* [Verify maturity of Twig engine](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/issues/285)

See https://github.com/pattern-lab/the-spec/issues/37 for more info.
