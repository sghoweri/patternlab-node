# Pattern Lab Node - Development Edition Engine React

_here be dragons_

This Development Edition is a variant of [Edition Node Gulp](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/tree/master/packages/edition-node-gulp) for convience purposes only, loaded with the React Engine. The goals of this Development Edition are two-fold:

* Develop the [React Engine](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/tree/master/packages/engine-react)
* Build and test against React pattern tree

If you'd like to help with the React Engine, please reference the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

> Development Editions of Pattern Lab provide the ability to work on and commit changes to select packages within the overall Pattern Lab [ecosystem](http://patternlab.io/docs/advanced-ecosystem-overview.html). This Edition is NOT stable.
