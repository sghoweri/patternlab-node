# Pattern Lab Node - Development Edition Engine Handlebars

_here be dragons_

This Development Edition is a variant of [Edition Node](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/tree/master/packages/edition-node) for convience purposes only, loaded with the Handlebars Engine. The goals of this Development Edition are two-fold:

* Develop the [Handlebars Engine](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/tree/master/packages/engine-handlebars)
* Build and test against Handlebars pattern tree

> Development Editions of Pattern Lab provide the ability to work on and commit changes to select packages within the overall Pattern Lab [ecosystem](http://patternlab.io/docs/advanced-ecosystem-overview.html). This Edition is NOT stable.
